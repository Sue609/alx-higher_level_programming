This sis an introduction to python which is a high level programming language.
Python is the second language that we will look ata after the C language.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991. Python is an open-source language, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

Some of the key features of Python include:

1. Readable syntax: Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, with a focus on simplicity and clarity.
2. Dynamic typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means that variables do not need to be declared before use and can change type as needed during runtime.
3. Interpreted: Python code is interpreted, rather than compiled, which makes it easy to test and debug.
4. Object-oriented: Python is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports the creation and manipulation of objects and classes.
5. Large standard library: Python has a large and comprehensive standard library that includes modules for everything from file I/O to networking to regular expressions.
