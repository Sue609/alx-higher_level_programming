matrix_divided is a function that divides all the elements of the matrix. The matrix must be a list of integers. The elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to two decimal places.

Args:
	The function accepts integers and floats to a matrix

Return:
	The function returns a new matrix which can either be made up of floats or ints.

Raises:
	TypeErrror and ZeroDivisionError

Example:
	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

The matrix should only be made up of integers and floats
	>>> matrix = [[3, 6, 9], [12, 15, 18]]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

The matrix should accomodate negative integers
	>>> matrix = [[-2, 4, -6], [-3, 9, 12]]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[-0.67, 1.33, -2.0], [-1.0, 3.0, 4.0]]
	

The matrix should be able to divide float numbers:
	>>> matrix = [[12.5, 8.6, 6.9],	[6.6, 4.8, 3.1]]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[4.17, 2.87, 2.3], [2.2, 1.6, 1.03]]

If matrix is not an int or float raise error exception:
	>>> matrix = [[1, 3, "pi"], [24, 6, 9]]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

When the rows of the matrix are not the same raise a TypeError:
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Div must be a number otherwise we print a typeeror
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, "str", 6]]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "sue"))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: div must be a number

Div can't be zero otherwise rause a ZeroDivisionError.
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, -1]]

	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

	>>> matrix = [[]]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[]]
