matrix_mul is a function that multiplies two matrices

Args:
	m_a and m_b must be a list of integers and floats

Return:
	The function returns the multiplied matrice.

Example:
	>>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul
	>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	[[7, 10], [15, 22]]

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2]]
	>>> m_b = [[3, 4], [5, 6]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	[[13, 16]]

	>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
	>>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied

	>>> print(matrix_mul([], [[1, 2]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: m_a can't be empty or m_b can't be empty

	>>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: m_a can't be empty or m_b can't be empty

	>>> print(matrix_mul([[]], []))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: m_a can't be empty or m_b can't be empty

The funstion only accepts integers and floats 
	>>> print(matrix_mul("sues", [[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: m_a must be a list or m_b must be a list

	>>> print(matrix_mul("susan", "kamau"))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: m_a must be a list or m_b must be a list

	>>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4]]))
	Traceback: (most recent call last):
	ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied
